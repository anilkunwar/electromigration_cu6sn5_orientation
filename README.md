# Description 
This repository contains the codes and datasets used to generate some of the results in the paper [1] titled 
“Phase field modelling combined with data-driven approach to unravel the orientation influenced growth of interfacial Cu6Sn5 intermetallics under electric current stressing.”

The brief descriptions of the content within the data and code files are provided as following:
a. The "grainTheta.csv" file consists the datasets generated from multiple phase field simulations.
   Name of the columns in the csv file
   gnid = grain id;
   ntheta = orientation angle of nth grain;
   nltheta = orientation angle of grain to the left of nth grain;
   nrtheta = orientation angle of grain to the right of nth grain;
   j = current density;
   t = time;
   area	= area of nth grain;
   tl = ;
